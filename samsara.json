Check out our FAQ [here](https://developers.samsara.com/docs/introducing-our-next-generation-api) to see what's changed and learn how to get started.<br>\n<br>\nWant to access the legacy API docs? You can find them [here](https://www.samsara.com/api-legacy).<br>\n<br>\n*Note: Because this is a new set of APIs, we have not transitioned all endpoints over to this standard. Endpoints that still use the legacy standards are indicated in the reference documentation. If you can't find an API that you're looking for, we encourage you to look for it in our [legacy API docs](https://www.samsara.com/api-legacy) as we continue to transition all endpoints over. Check back here for updates!*<br>\n<br>\nSubmit your feedback [here](https://forms.gle/r4bs6HQshQAvBuwv6)!\n</nb>\n</n>\n\nSamsara provides API endpoints so that you can build powerful applications and custom solutions with sensor data. Samsara has endpoints available to track and analyze sensors, vehicles, and entire fleets.\n\nThe Samsara API is a [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). It uses standard [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) authentication, verbs, and response codes, and it returns [JSON](http://www.json.org/) response bodies. If you're familiar with what you can build with a REST API, then this will be your go-to API reference.\n\nVisit [developers.samsara.com](https://developers.samsara.com) to find getting started guides and an API overview.\n\nIf you have any questions, please visit https://samsara.com/help.\n\n## Endpoints\n\nAll our APIs can be accessed through HTTP requests to URLs like:\n\n```\nhttps://api.samsara.com/<endpoint>\n```\n\nFor EU customers, this URL will be:\n\n```\nhttps://api.eu.samsara.com/<endpoint>\n```\n\n<n class=\"warning\">\n<nh>\n<i class=\"fa fa-exclamation-circle\"></i>\nNote\n</nh>\n<nb>\nLegacy endpoints will have the URL: `https://api.samsara.com/v1/<endpoint>` or `https://api.eu.samsara.com/v1/<endpoint>`\n</nb>\n</n>\n\n## Authentication\n\nTo authenticate your API request you will need to include your secret token. You can manage your API tokens in the [Dashboard](https://cloud.samsara.com). They are visible under `Settings->Organization->API Tokens`.\n\nYour API tokens carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure. Do not share your secret API tokens in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so on.\n\nAuthentication to the API is performed via Bearer Token in the HTTP Authorization header. Provide your API token as the `access_token` value in an `Authorization: Bearer` header. You do not need to provide a password:\n\n```curl\nAuthorization: Bearer {access_token}\n```\n\nAll API requests must be made over [HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS). Calls made over plain HTTP or without authentication will fail.\n\n### OAuth2\nIf building an application for our marketplace, our API is accessible via. OAuth2 as well.\n\n| Type  | Value |\n| ------------- |:-------------:|\n| Security scheme      | OAuth2                                   |\n| OAuth2 Flow          | accessCode                               |\n| Authorization URL    | https://api.samsara.com/oauth2/authorize |\n| Token URL            | https://api.samsara.com/oauth2/token     |\n\n\n\n## Common Patterns\n\nYou can find more info about request methods, response codes, error codes, versioning, pagination, timestamps, and mini-objects [here](https://developers.samsara.com/docs/common-structures).\n","title":"Samsara API","version":"2024-11-18"},"openapi":"3.0.1","paths":{"/addresses":{"get":{"description":"Returns a list of all addresses in an organization. \n\n **Submit Feedback**: Likes, dislikes, and API feature requests should be filed as feedback in our <a href=\"https://forms.gle/zkD4NCH7HjKb7mm69\" target=\"_blank\">API feedback form</a>.
