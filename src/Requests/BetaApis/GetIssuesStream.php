/**
 * getIssuesStream.
 *
 * Returns all issues data that has been created or modified for your organization based on the time
 * parameters passed in. Results are paginated and are sorted by last modified date. If you include an
 * endTime, the endpoint will return data up until that point (exclusive). If you donâ€™t include an
 * endTime, you can continue to poll the API real-time with the pagination cursor that gets returned on
 * every call.
 *
 * **Beta:** This endpoint is in beta and is likely to change before being broadly
 * available. Reach out to your Samsara Representative to have Forms APIs enabled for your
 * organization.
 *
 *  <b>Rate limit:</b> 5 requests/sec (learn more about rate limits <a
 * href="https://developers.samsara.com/docs/rate-limits" target="_blank">here</a>).
 *
 * To use this
 * endpoint, select **Read Issues** under the Closed Beta category when creating or editing an API
